Below are the instructions provided and guidelines to completing the task:

Identify an SVG map of the world you will use to provide the visual interface for this project.

Using either the GeoNames  or Worldbank  API, identify each of the following six properties for each country:
    country name (e.g., Chad)
    country capital (e.g., N’Djamena)
    country region (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa)
    income level (e.g., low income)
two additional country properties of your choice

Assign the map component to the default URL using an Angular routing module.

Create an HTML layout with two columns: one column for the map itself and one column to show the required country information from the API in part B.

Convert the SVG map into an interactive Angular component by connecting all the “path” tags inside the SVG file to mouse event handlers, so each path is recognized and transmitted to the parent component hosting the map if a mouse event occurs.

Generate an API service that uses the built-in Angular module HTTP client to make HTTP calls and include the following:
one method that accepts a country name as an input parameter that returns additional information gathered from the API for the selected country
one method that will trigger the API call when a country is selected and set a local variable that will receive the information about the country for display in the right column of the HTML page

Provide a compressed file of your website, including each of the following files:
    HTML
    TS
    SVG
    JSON configuration files
    
Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

Rubric
Review each of the rubric categories and then check out the three possible rankings:

Not Evident (your ability to demonstrate the course competency in this assessment is not evident)
Approaching Competence (your competency in this area is still developing)
Competent (you have successfully demonstrated competency in this area)
 You must achieve a ranking of Competent on each task to pass the course.

A: Identify an SVG

The submission does not identify an SVG map of the world to provide the visual interface.

Not applicable.

The submission identifies an SVG map of the world to provide the visual interface.

B: API Web Links

An API is not identified.

The API identified is not listed in the Web Links section. Or the API does not provide all 6 of the given properties for each country.

The API identified is listed in the Web Links section and contains all 6 properties for each country.

C: Angular Routing Module

The map component is not assigned to the default URL.

The map component is assigned to the default URL but does not use an Angular routing module.

The map component is assigned to the default URL using an Angular routing module.

D: HTML Layout

An HTML layout is not created.

The HTML layout is created but does not provide both columns, 1 for the map itself and 1 to show the required country information from the API in Category B.

The HTML layout is created and includes 2 columns, 1 column for the map itself and 1 column to show the required country information from the API in Category B.

E: Conversion to Angular Component

The SVG map is not converted into an interactive Angular component.

The SVG map is converted into an interactive Angular component, but 1 or more of the "path" tags inside the SVG file are not connected to mouse event handlers. Or the map does not function correctly.

The SVG map is converted into an interactive Angular component with all of the "path" tags inside the SVG file connected to mouse event handlers so that each path is transmitted to the parent component hosting the map. The map functions correctly.

F: API Service

An API service is not generated.

The API service does not use the built-in Angular module HTTP client to make HTTP calls. Or the API service does not include both required methods. Or 1 or both of the required methods do not function correctly.

The API service is generated and uses the built-in Angular module HTTP client to make HTTP calls and includes both required methods, and both methods function correctly.

G: Compressed File

I: Professional Communication 

Content is unstructured, is disjointed, or contains pervasive errors in mechanics, usage, or grammar. Vocabulary or tone is unprofessional or distracts from the topic.

Content is poorly organized, is difficult to follow, or contains errors in mechanics, usage, or grammar that cause confusion. Terminology is misused or ineffective.

Content reflects attention to detail, is organized, and focuses on the main ideas as prescribed in the task or chosen by the candidate. Terminology is pertinent, is used correctly, and effectively conveys the intended meaning. Mechanics, usage, and grammar promote accurate interpretation and understanding.
